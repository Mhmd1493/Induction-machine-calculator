A computer program to draw the developed torque and input current verses the motor speed (or the motor slip) in case of starting a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor in cases of:
1. Direct online starting.
2. Star delta starter
3. Autotransformer with a=0.4, 0.6, 0.8
The inputs to the program are the rated voltage, rated frequency, no of poles, and motor rated speed. In addition to, the parameters of the equivalent circuit of the motor.
